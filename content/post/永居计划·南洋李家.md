## Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS)

***按道理说，马来西亚理科大学计算机相关专业毕业，在新加坡找技术类工作，可忽略其他条件满足20+20的COMPASS合格条件。***

互补性评估框架（及格分数：40分）

Your candidate will earn +20 bonus points on COMPASS for filling a role on the SOL.

Your candidate’s bonus points will be reduced from +20 to +10 if their nationality forms one-third or higher of your firm’s PMETs. This encourages resilience and diversity in firms, especially in areas requiring critical skills.
